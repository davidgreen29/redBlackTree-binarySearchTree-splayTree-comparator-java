# redBlackTree-binarySearchTree-splayTree-comparator-java
This program creates three types of trees and compares their run times 

navigation

inside the src folder you can find seperate folders containing each of the trees I created and a main comparsion application. 

inside the Binary search tree folder is located all the code for the BST. 

inside the splay tree folder is located all the code for the splay tree. 

inside the comparison folder is the main comparison app and the red black tree. 

The Main comparison app populates each tree with random values and will return run times so that you 
can see which structure is the fastest. 

I implemented the code for the BST in an early project to accept generic objects and later modified it 
to run in this application.
